*************************************************************************************
*This is a file to track all the resources/material we are using that has not been
* created from scratch, such as the website template, pictures, textures and such.
*
*
*Base copies and original images can be kept under the directory (pickupgames\resources). This
*way if we break something and don't know why we can use it as a reference or if
*we edit an image for the site and need to restart with the original we have a copy.
*
* DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES. Copy to the main directory for our website (pickupgames\)
* and conduct edits there.
