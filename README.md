Get In the Game

It's a site for setting up and finding pickup games so you can make friends on the internet outside.

Installation:

1. If you haven't already, clone the git file into your preferred directory.
2. Open mySQL. You have to source two sql files: install.sql and geodist.sql. We recommend using the full path to the files.
3. localhost/yourdirectory and go. Have a blast.

Features:

1. login/logout
2. Make a detailed user profile (but you can't share it yet)
3. Set up an event
4. Find events (using way cool distance coordinates based on the zip code you enter when you sign up)

That's about it right now.

Future updates:
1. Make some friends with your actual profile
2. On that note, integration with the Facebook API if we're feeling froggy.

Things that will screw up if you poke them too hard:

1. That picture upload on the profile page doesn't upload anything. It's just the path to a picture you direct it to
on your hard disk. Can't see anything wrong with that, no siree.
