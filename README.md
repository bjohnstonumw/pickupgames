Get In the Game

It's a site for setting up and finding pickup games so you can make friends on the internet outside.

Installation:

1. If you haven't already, clone the git into your preferred directory.
2. Open mySQL. You have to source two sql files: install/install.sql.
3. Point your browser to localhost/yourdirectory and go. Have a blast.

Features:

1. login/logout/register
2. Find events (using way cool distance magic based on the zip code you enter when you sign up)
3. Make a detailed user profile (but you can't share it yet)
4. Set up an event
5. Check out some rules for all the sports we offer.

Default Accounts:
1. user: jake password: jake zipcode: 20601
2. user: smith password: smith zipcode: 22485

That's about it right now.

Future updates:
1. Make some friends with your profile
2. On that note, integration with the Facebook API if we're feeling froggy.

Things that will screw up if you poke them too hard:

1. That picture upload on the profile page doesn't upload anything. It's just the path to a picture you direct it to
on your hard disk. Can't see anything wrong with that, no siree.
